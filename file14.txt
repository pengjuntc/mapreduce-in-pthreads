Lord

Lenox
My
former
Speeches
Haue
but
hit
your
Thoughts
Which
can
interpret
farther
Onely
I
say
Things
haue
bin
strangely
borne
The
gracious
Duncan
Was
pittied
of
Macbeth
marry
he
was
dead
And
the
right
valiant
Banquo
walkd
too
late
Whom
you
may
say
ift
please
you
Fleans
killd
For
Fleans
fled
Men
must
not
walke
too
late
Who
cannot
want
the
thought
how
monstrous
It
was
for
Malcolme
and
for
Donalbane
To
kill
their
gracious
Father
Damned
Fact
How
it
did
greeue
Macbeth
Did
he
not
straight
In
pious
rage
the
two
delinquents
teare
That
were
the
Slaues
of
drinke
and
thralles
of
sleepe
Was
not
that
Nobly
done
I
and
wisely
too
For
twould
haue
angerd
any
heart
aliue
To
heare
the
men
denyt
So
that
I
say
He
has
borne
all
things
well
and
I
do
thinke
That
had
he
Duncans
Sonnes
vnder
his
Key
As
andt
please
Heauen
he
shall
not
they
should
finde
What
twere
to
kill
a
Father
So
should
Fleans
But
peace
for
from
broad
words
and
cause
he
fayld
His
presence

Tyrants
Feast

heare
Macduffe
