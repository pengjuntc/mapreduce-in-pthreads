Project
Gutenberg
Etexts
are
usually
created
from
multiple
editions
all
of
which
are
in
the
Public
Domain
in
the
United
States
unless
a
copyright
notice
is
included
Therefore
we
usually
do
NOT
keep
any
of
these
books
in
compliance
with
any
particular
paper
edition


We
are
now
trying
to
release
all
our
books
one
month
in
advance
of
the
official
release
dates
leaving
time
for
better
editing

Please
note
neither
this
list
nor
its
contents
are
final
till
midnight
of
the
last
day
of
the
month
of
any
such
announcement
The
official
release
date
of
all
Project
Gutenberg
Etexts
is
at
Midnight
Central
Time
of
the
last
day
of
the
stated
month
A
preliminary
version
may
often
be
posted
for
suggestion
comment
and
editing
by
those
who
wish
to
do
so
To
be
sure
you
have
an
up
to
date
first
edition
xxxxx10xxxx
please
check
file
sizes
in
the
first
week
of
the
next

Since
our
ftp
program
has
a
bug
in
it
that
scrambles
the
date
tried
to
fix
and
failed
a
look
at
the
file
size
will
have
to
do
but
we
will
try
to
see
a
new

has
at

We
produce
about
two
million
dollars
for
each
hour
we
work
The
time
it
takes
us
a
rather
conservative
estimate
is
fifty
hours
to
get
any
etext
selected
entered
proofread
edited
copyright
searched
and
analyzed
the
copyright
letters
written
etc
This
projected
audience
is
one
hundred
million
readers
If
our
value
per
text
is
nominally
estimated
at
one
dollar
then
we
produce
2
million
dollars
per
hour
this
year
as
we
release
thirtysix
text
files
per
month
or
432
more
Etexts
in
1999
for
a
total
of
2000
If
these
reach
just
10
of
the
computerized
population
then
the
total
should
reach
over
200
billion
Etexts
given
away
this
year

The
Goal
of
Project
Gutenberg
is
to
Give
Away
One
Trillion
Etext
Files
by
December
31
2001
10000
x
100000000
1
Trillion
This
is
ten
thousand
titles
each
to
one
hundred
million
readers
which
is
only
5
of
the
present
number
of
computer
users

At
our
revised
rates
of
production
we
will
reach
only
onethird
of
that
goal
by
the
end
of
2001
or
about
3333
Etexts
unless
we
manage
to
get
some
real
funding
currently
our
funding
is
mostly
from
Michael
Harts
salary
at
CarnegieMellon
University
and
an
assortment
of
sporadic
gifts
this
salary
is
only
good
for
a
few
more
years
so
we
are
looking
for
something
to
replace
it
as
we
dont
want
Project
Gutenberg
to
be
so
dependent
on
one
person

Why
is
this
Small
Print
statement
here
You
know
lawyers
They
tell
us
you
might
sue
us
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
your
copy
of
this
etext
even
if
you
got
it
for
free
from
someone
other
than
us
and
even
if
whats
wrong
is
not
our
fault
So
among
other
things
this
Small
Print
statement
disclaims
most
of
our
liability
to
you
It
also
tells
you
